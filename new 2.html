<p> When Mother and Totto-chan went in, the man in the office got up from his chair. His hair was thin on top and he had a few teeth missing, but his face was a healthy colour. Although he wasn't very tall, he had solid shoulders and arms and was neatlu dressed in a rather shabby black three-piece suit.</p>
<p> With a hastu bow, Totto-chan asled him spiritedly<font size="4" face="Times" color="red"><b><u>"What are you, a schoolmaster or a stationmaster?",</u></b></font></p>
<p> Mother was embarrassed, but before she had time to explain, he laubhed and replied, <font size="4" face="Times" color="purple"><b><u>"I'm the head-master of this school."</u></b></font></P>
<p> Tooto-chan was delighted.<font size="4" face="Times" color="green"><b><u> "Oh I'm so glad",</u></b></font> 'because I want to ask you a favour. I'd like to came to your school."</p>
<p> The head-master offered her a chair and turnred to mother.<font size="4" face="Times" color="orange"><b><u> "You may go home now. Iwant to talk Totto-chan."</u></b></font></p>
<p> Totto-chan had a moment's uneasiness, but somehow felt she would get along all right with this man.<font size="4" face="Times" color="blue"><b> <u>"Well, then, I'll leave her with you,"</u></b></font> Mother said bravely, and shut the door behind her as she went out.</P>
<p> The headmaster drew over a chair and put it facing Totto-chan, and when they were both sitting down close together, he said, <font size="4" face="Times" color="pink"><b><u>"Now then, tell me all about yourself. Tell me anything at all you wajt to talk about."</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times" color="yellow"><b><u>"Anything I like?"</u></b></font> Totto-chan had expected him to ask questions she would have to answer. When he said she could talk about anything she wanted, she was so happy she began straight away. It eas all a bit higgledy-piggledy, but she talked foe all she was worth. She told the headmaster how fast the train went that they had come on; how she had asked the ticket collector but he wouldn't let her keep her ticket; how pretty her homeroom teacher was at the other school; about the swalllpws' nest; about their brown dog, Rocky, wgi could do all sorts of tricks; how she used to go snip-snip with the scissors insieds her mouth at kindergarten and the teacher said she mustn't do that because she might cut her tongue off, but she did it anyway; how she always blew her nose because mother scolded her if it was runny; what a good swimmer Daddy was, snd ho he could dive as well. She ean out of things ro say. She sat with her mouth closed trying hard to think of something.</p>
